										Gives confidence to refactor, resulting in improved design and better maintainability,

										If something gets broken, unit tests give you (almost) instant feedback, as opposed to several days or weeks, if the

								Unit Tests Should Be Trustworthy
							</dt>
							<dd>
								The test must fail if the code is broken and only if the code is broken. If it does not, we cannot trust what the test
								results are telling us.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Unit Tests Should Be Maintainable and Readable
							</dt>
							<dd>
								When production code changes, tests often need to be updated, and possibly debugged as well. Therefore, it must be easy
								to read and understand the test, not only for whoever wrote it, but for other developers as well. Always organize and
								name your tests for clarity and readability.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Unit Tests Should Verify a Single-Use Case
							</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>
									Good tests validate one thing and one thing only, which means that typically, they validate a single use-case. Tests
									that follow this best practice are simpler and more understandable, and that is good for maintainability and debugging.
									Tests that validate more than one thing can easily become complex and time-consuming to maintain.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another best practice is to use a minimal number of assertions. Some people recommend just one assertion per test (this
									may be a little too restrictive); the idea is to focus on validating only what is needed for the use-case you are
									testing.
								</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Unit Tests Should Be Isolated
							</dt>
							<dd>
								Tests should be runnable on any machine, in any order, without affecting each other. If possible, tests should have no
								dependencies on environmental factors or global/external state. Tests that have these dependencies are harder to run and
								usually unstable, making them harder to debug and fix, and end up costing more time than they save.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Unit Tests Should Be Automated
							</dt>
							<dd>
								Make sure tests are being run in an automated process. This can be daily, or every hour, or in a Continuous Integration
								or Delivery process. The reports need to be accessible and reviewed by everyone on the team. As a team, talk about which
								metrics you care about: code coverage, modified code coverage, number of tests being run, performance, etc.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Unit Tests Should Be Executed Within an Organized Test Practice
							</dt>
							<dd>
								In order to drive the success of your testing at all levels, and make the unit testing process scalable and sustainable,
								you will need some additional practices in place. This means writing unit tests as you write your application code. Some
								organizations write the tests before the application code (test-driven or behavior-driven programming). The important
								thing is that tests go hand-in-hand with the application code. The tests and application code should even be reviewed
								together in the code review process. Reviews help you understand the code being written (because they can see the
								expected behavior) and improve tests.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Adopt a zero-tolerance policy for failing tests
							</dt>
							<dd>
								Test failures should indicate real issues, so those issues should be addressed right away. Waiting may waste QA time or
								inadvertently release a bug to production. The longer it takes to address failures, the more time and money those
								failures will ultimately cost your organization. Run tests during refactoring, run tests right before you commit code,
								and do not let a task be considered "done" until the tests are passing too.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								Aim for at least 70% code branch coverage
							</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>
									In general, code coverage is a measurement of how much of the production code is executed while your automated tests are
									running. By running a suite of tests and looking at code coverage data, you can get a general sense of how much of your
									application is being tested.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are many kinds of code coverage — the most common ones are line coverage and branch coverage. Most tools focus on
									line coverage, which just tells you if a specific line was covered. Branch is more granular, as it tells you if each
									path through the code is covered.
								</p>
								<p>
									Code coverage is an important metric, but remember that increasing it is a means to an end. It's great for finding gaps
									in testing, but it's not the only thing to focus on. Be careful not to spend too much effort trying to achieve 100%
									coverage — it may not even be possible or feasible. The quality of your tests is the important thing. That being said,
									achieving at least 60% coverage for your projects is a good starting point, and 80% or more is a good goal to set.
									It's also valuable if you have automated tools that not only measure code coverage but also keep track how much modified
									code is being covered by tests, because this can provide visibility into whether enough tests are being written along
									with changes in production code.
